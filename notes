Only difference between my DQN and the one in the turtorial is that the turtorial uses cartpole and the input
state is an image. Actions is just left or right

Implement enviroment reset?

Typical DQN computes V_s(t+1) for all actions, in my case, this will be very computationally expensive, some
sort of optimization needed
