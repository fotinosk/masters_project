this model doesn't implment L2 weight decay of batch normalization, 
maybe add different hidden states too
change window size
change criteriion

I think what they are doing with the expirences is wrong. I think 
it's meant ot be iterating over the batch not the individual components


Chenges to be evaluated:
- Added batch norms to actor and critic
